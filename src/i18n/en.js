        I'm a freelance Web Developer with {years} years of experience in the IT industry. I help startups launch and grow their products.
        <br/><br/>
        My main focus is on <b>JavaScript</b> and its related ecosystem.
        <br/><br/>
        As a <b>Full-Stack Developer</b>, I specialize in apps based on Node.js, Vue.js and Angular. I'm able to build a completed solution from sketches to production.
        <br/><br/>
        My second specialization is building <b>Cross-platform Mobile Applications</b> with the use of Flutter SDK (Dart) & Ionic Framework (Angular/Cordova).
        <br/><br/>
        I have a great experience in <b>UI/UX</b> and I'm well-versed in matters of typography, whitespace, color selection, and some of best practices. I do produce prototypes of my own as well, but my focus is always more geared toward mechanics and cost since I don't classify myself as a Web Designer.
        <br/><br/>
        I started my way as a Full-Stack Web Developer in a company and grew to a <b>Team Leader</b> position in a few years. After almost 3 years working for companies and a variety of startups, I decided to start a freelancing career which gave me the freedom to work on all sorts of projects with different kinds of businesses &mdash; from environmental organizations to Upwork-like platforms where businesses and independent professionals connect and collaborate remotely.
        <br/><br/>
        I also teach as a <b>Coding Mentor</b>, mostly to individuals seeking new coding jobs.
        <br/><br/>

        Personal skills:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Self-management. As a professional freelancer, I have to combine the skills of a project manager, developer and tester. And everything seems to be fine with my self-management, as I still like what I do :)
          </li>
          <li>
            Team management. I had the experience of leading developers teams in building web-based systems.

          <li>
            Able to explain complex problems to non-software engineers and assist in troubleshooting. Well, no one has yet complained :)
